This is a college project that I created called Horizons, which is an application that uses the discogs search API to search for albums
using keywords. These albums can be referenced by index starting at 0 and are saved to the user's respective firebase database, and can be
searched for using the "my albums" button. Login information using email and password is also stored in Firebase.

The language that is used is Kotlin.
